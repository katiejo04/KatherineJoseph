4) Data Preparation/System Design

	After the variables were collected and combined, the data preparation began. First, all of the daily volume variables for each cryptocurrency needed to be changed from an object to a float. The daily volume data represents the daily volume in thousands. Some of the interactions though, were in millions and billions and included a ‘M’ or ‘B’ next to the value. In order to change all daily volume variables to a float, the iterations that were in millions or billions were changed to thousands. Once all of the data was numeric, missing values were removed. The missing values in the data were in the non-cryptocurrency variables (oil_usd, gold_usd, silver_usd, Euronext_cls, Euronext_v, DJ_cls, DJ_v, JP_cls, JP_v, HK_cls, HK_v, NASDAQ_cls, NASDAQ_v, NYSE_cls, NYSE_v, DFF). This was due to the fact that cryptocurrency markets are open seven days a week, and other financial markets are open five days a week. In order to fill in the missing values, a forward filling method was used because the data is a time series. After all missing values and error values were removed the data was split into training (75%) and testing datasets(25%). 
	Next, the training and testing datasets (excluding y) were processed using three different pipelines:


	
	The processed data from each pipeline were ranked by the average F-score of the features selected by K-means. This entire data preparation process was completed for each version of y.

6) Interpretation / Application

The results from this analysis confirm and lead to a few important insights on Bitcoin’s daily close price. To start, it’s important to note how success is being measured. For continuous y, R2, mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error are used since a regressor model is utilized. More specifically, success is indicated by a higher R2 but a lower Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. The regression models are also successful when there is a smaller absolute difference between the results of the test data versus the results from the train data. This is because the model already knows the training x values and the training y values. On the other hand, the model is only given the testing x values and needs to predict the testing y values. Therefore, the results from the training data are a good benchmark. The categorical y and binary y both have success measured by overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. All of these measures indicate more success as they increase. 
 Overall, continuous y has contrasting results compared to categorical and binary y. The top model for continuous y is Random Forest Regressor that only includes non-cryptocurrency features. This model has the lowest absolute difference for two out of the three success measures (R2 and MSE), and also has the lowest MSE and MAPE, plus the highest R2. Furthermore, the R2 for this model is 0.9859, which is almost a perfect measure for R2 (R2 is better if closer to 1.0). 
The results for the categorical y and binary y though, are quite different. The best model for both versions of y is the Random Forest model. With this model, the highest accuracy for categorical y and binary y is just over 50 percent. In order to ensure that all tested models are close to the best possible model for predicting categorical y and binary y, TPOT was used. TPOT indicates that even the best model for both versions of y is just over 50 percent. This result is less surprising after comparing these results to related analyses. For example, Patrick Jaquart and his team attempted to predict Bitcoin price movement by minute.  After using multiple machine learning models, including neural networks, the best models only resulted in just over 50 percent accuracy. 
The confirmation of the validity of the results for categorical y and binary y leads me to question the validity of the results for continuous y. Furthermore, it is especially important to question the results since the best R2 value is almost close to perfect. Specifically, I believe the models that are predicting continuous y are overfitting. The main reason for this is most likely due to the independent variables. Most of the independent variables are either global financial markets and other cryptocurrencies. In general, both types of features tend to trend together. This resulted in the model learning from features that are too similar, and ends up leading to a model that overfits. 
There are a few great takeaways from this analysis even though the continuous model may be overfitting, and the categorical and binary y had a low accuracy. To start, one can be almost certain that there is no valid way to currently predict the daily close price of Bitcoin. Even more so, an educated investor has the same likelihood of predicting the daily Bitcoin close price as a random individual off the street. The correlation analysis though, can confirm that most cryptocurrency prices are highly correlated. This is not true though, for stable coins such as Dai, Tether, and Binace. This is indicated by the low correlation compared to the close price of Bitcoin and other coins. This makes sense though, since stablecoins tend to stay at relatively the same price. It is also noteworthy that the federal funds rate has a fairly high negative correlation with the Bitcoin daily close price. This tracks, since historically there have been large drops or increases in the price of Bitcoin when the federal fund rate was largely changed. The most interesting correlation to note though, is between some of the global financial markets and Bitcoin. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have always been thought of as an alternative investment compared to financial markets. Some of the correlation results, though, indicate that cryptocurrencies and some financial markets may trend in similar directions. The highest correlated financial markets are Dow Jones, NASDAQ, and NYSE. This demonstrates that the idea of cryptocurrencies as an alternative investment may need to be reconsidered in the future.




7) Next Steps

	In the future, I would like to continue this analysis by trying to understand if the continuous models are really overfitting. This could be done in the future by using more diverse features. Even more so, the correlation results indicate that if some features are collected (such as Ethereum), other features such as the non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies do not also need to be collected. This would allow other diverse features to have a stronger influence on the model.


8) Appendix

8a) June 6th, 2022 Weekly Update Report

My main goal this week was to incorporate the feedback I received during my capstone project proposal. This included removing data that was not a daily value (GDP, median US housing price, Bitcoin ATMs, and climate data). The feedback also noted that I cannot backfill NaN cryptocurrency daily closing prices and volume with zero. This was originally done because the data was not available. Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency, so it is difficult to find other cryptocurrencies that have close to as much historical data. It was suggested though, that I take a closer look at the historical data of the top 20 cryptocurrencies to find the more historical data.
Unfortunately, I was not able to progress with my capstone project as much as I wanted to this week. This was due mainly to the fact that I started a new demanding job on Monday and because I was sick over the weekend. Ultimately though, I was able to remove non-daily values from my dataframe and I was able to find a better source for historical data of the top cryptocurrencies. I searched through the top 25 cryptocurrencies (ranked by market cap), and was able to find 11 cryptocurrencies (not including Bitcoin) that had more historical data. I was also able to find even more historical data for Bitcoin. Out of the 11 cryptocurrencies I pulled historical data from, the latest start date of the historical data was early 2018. I am still considering if the few cryptocurrencies with dating starting 2018 or late 2017 should be removed. Once all of the new data is loaded into collab, I will create a dataframe with a starting date that will is available for all of the cryptocurrencies. If this starting date is after september 2017 (the oldest date in my dataframe currently), I will need to recollect some of the other financial data I pulled (stock markets, price of gold, etc). 
This weekend and early next week I plan to dedicate a large portion of my time to working on my capstone. I need to finalize my data and rerun my initial cleaning and EDA. Next I will need to run the data through multiple pre-processing pipelines. 
The pipelines will be: 1. Outlier IQR, Normalization, Standardization 2. Standardization (min-max), Normalization, Outlier Std 3. Normalization, Outlier Std, Standardization Z-score. Each pipeline will also include feature selection. Once the pipelines are complete, the data will be evaluated by F-1 score and ROC score. (June 12th)
I will then use the best dataset and features to move forward with my initial models: baseline models vs. predictive models.  I plan to try as many models as I have time for, even though I predict the most successful model will either be the logistic regression or XGBoost.(June 14th)


8b) June 13th, 2022 Weekly Update Report
My main goal in the past week was the finalize my data and rerun my initial EDA, run the data through three pre-processing pipelines, complete feature selection for each pipeline, and evaluate each pipeline. From there I found the best pipeline based on the pipeline data that had the average of F scores above 2.5 and 4.0 for the selected features. This evaluation revealed that my second pipeline (Standardization (min-max), Normalization, Outlier Std) was the best data to move forward with. 
After that, I began trying to fit my data to different models. Specifically, I began doing research on the best machine learning models to use for a time-series dataset. When I was doing this research though, I found that many of the examples and models for time-series did not reflect my goal for this project. This made me rethink my approach and what my y would be.
After reflecting on the goal of my capstone and the data I collected, I decided the best way to move forward would be with y1 only. From there I also decided that I wanted y1 to be the percentage change in the daily close price, instead of the daily close price of Bitcoin. In order to have more flexibility with the machine learning models I can use, I decided to bin y into 5 categories. Now, y is equal to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 based on the following bins: 0 if less than -0.3, 1 if greater than or equal to -0.3 and less than -0.2, 2 if greater than or equal to -0.2 and less than -0.1, 3 if greater than or equal to -0.1 and less than 0, 4 if greater than or equal to 0 and less than 0.1, and 5 if greater than or equal to 0.1. 
My goal for tonight and tomorrow is to rerun all of my current notebooks with the new y, and re-evaluate each pre-processing pipeline. I will choose the best pipeline based on the same evaluation criteria I mentioned earlier. This weekend, I plan to move forward with finding the best model. I will try multiple models including: K-means, decision tree, naive bayes, random forest, XGBoost, and SVM. If time permits, I hope to also run SMOTE to understand what the best model and model parameters are. After I receive the initial model results I plan to tune the hyperparameters to get better results.
MAPE
Find a threshold (positive and negative change) for the third model. Find the best model. How to derive the conclusion and results
 run SMOTE
Run some models without any other cryptocurrencies since their trends are very similar to Bitcoin. This might be the reason that caused a high R square.
